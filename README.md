# My Personal Blog

## Description

As a marketing student, I created a personal blog to showcase my thoughts and experiences.


## Demo

The GIF below is what they'd like my blog to look like.

## The Creation

I created this repository which includes all the neccesary files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As requested, I set up a personal blog where, when you first visit, you'll see a page with a form asking for your username, blog title, and content. After you submit your blog post, it's saved so you can come back to it later. If you forget to fill out any part of the form, a message pops up reminding you. Once your post is submitted, you're taken to a page where you can see all your posts. On that page, there's a switch to change between light and dark modes, and a "Back" button to go back to the form to add more posts. Each post shows the title, content, and author. You can also find a link to my portfolio in the footer.
